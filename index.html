                <div class="founder one">
                    <img src="img/f1.jpg" alt="" class="imgF">
                    <p>Stephen Gary Wozniak (/ˈwɒzniæk/; born August 11, 1950), also known by his nickname "Woz", is an
                        American technology entrepreneur, electronics engineer, computer scientist, computer programmer,
                        philanthropist, and inventor. In 1976, he co-founded Apple Computer with his late business
                        partner Steve Jobs, which later became the world's largest technology company by revenue and the
                        largest company in the world by market capitalization. Through his work at Apple in the 1970s
                        and 1980s, he is widely recognized as one of the most prominent pioneers of the personal
                        computer revolution.[4]

                        In 1975, Wozniak started developing the Apple I[5]: 150  into the computer that launched Apple
                        when he and Jobs first began marketing it the following year. He primarily designed the Apple
                        II, introduced in 1977, known as one of the first highly successful mass-produced
                        microcomputers,[6] while Jobs oversaw the development of its foam-molded plastic case and early
                        Apple employee Rod Holt developed its switching power supply.[7] With human–computer interface
                        expert Jef Raskin, Wozniak had a major influence over the initial development of the original
                        Apple Macintosh concepts from 1979 to 1981, when Jobs took over the project following Wozniak's
                        brief departure from the company due to a traumatic airplane accident.[8][3] After permanently
                        leaving Apple in 1985, Wozniak founded CL 9 and created the first programmable universal remote,
                        released in 1987. He then pursued several other businesses and philanthropic ventures throughout
                        his career, focusing largely on technology in K–12 schools.[3]

                        As of February 2020, Wozniak has remained an employee of Apple in a ceremonial capacity since
                        stepping down in 1985.[9][10] In recent years, he has helped fund multiple entrepreneurial
                        efforts dealing in areas such as GPS and telecommunications, flash memory, technology and pop
                        culture conventions, technical education, ecology, satellites and more.</p>

                <div class="founder two">
                    <p>Steven Paul Jobs (February 24, 1955 – October 5, 2011) was an American business magnate,
                        inventor, and investor. He was the co-founder, chairman, and CEO of Apple; the chairman and
                        majority shareholder of Pixar; a member of The Walt Disney Company's board of directors
                        following its acquisition of Pixar; and the founder, chairman, and CEO of NeXT. He was a pioneer
                        of the personal computer revolution of the 1970s and 1980s, along with his early business
                        partner and fellow Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak.

                        Jobs was born in San Francisco to a Syrian father and German-American mother. He was adopted
                        shortly after his birth. Jobs attended Reed College in 1972 before withdrawing that same year.
                        In 1974, he traveled through India seeking enlightenment before later studying Zen Buddhism. He
                        and Wozniak co-founded Apple in 1976 to sell Wozniak's Apple I personal computer. Together the
                        duo gained fame and wealth a year later with production and sale of the Apple II, one of the
                        first highly successful mass-produced microcomputers. Jobs saw the commercial potential of the
                        Xerox Alto in 1979, which was mouse-driven and had a graphical user interface (GUI). This led to
                        the development of the unsuccessful Apple Lisa in 1983, followed by the breakthrough Macintosh
                        in 1984, the first mass-produced computer with a GUI. The Macintosh introduced the desktop
                        publishing industry in 1985 with the addition of the Apple LaserWriter, the first laser printer
                        to feature vector graphics.</p>

                    <p>Ronald Gerald Wayne (born May 17, 1934) is an American former businessman and electronics
                        industry pioneer. On April 1, 1976, Wayne, along with Steve Wozniak and Steve Jobs, drafted an
                        original contractual partnership agreement, creating the Apple Computer Company (now Apple
                        Inc.). Selected by Jobs, Wayne was included as a (10%) owner to arbitrate any disputes that
                        might arise between Jobs (45%) and Wozniak (45%). His vital set of complementary skills as a
                        technical writer, model builder, draftsman, and expert documentation system developer proved to
                        be a perfect dovetail match for the partnership.[citation needed] In addition to providing
                        administrative oversight and guidance for the fledgling venture, Wayne was instrumental at the
                        outset in establishing the proprietary nature of Apple products. As soon as Wayne successfully
                        persuaded Wozniak on this pivotal decision, the partnership was formed.Although he fully
                        supported the venture, Wayne elected to formally separate himself from this partnership just 12
                        days after it began. He went on to develop a new line of electronic slot machines replacing the
                        mechanical models of that period. Wayne relinquished his (10%) share of the partnership back to
                        Jobs and Wozniak for $800 (equivalent to $4,114 in 2022), and one year later accepted a final
                        payment of $1,500 (equivalent to $7,714 in 2022) to forfeit any potential future claims he might
                        assert against the newly incorporated Apple.[[</p>
